If you want to make a change at all, then you have some level of “desire.”

having a specific plan about when and where worked really well, but motivation didn't work at all.  Deciding in advance when and where you will take specific actions to reach your goal can double or triple your chances for success.

The researchers discovered that what pulls that desire out of you and turns it into real–world action isn't your level of motivation, but rather your plan for implementation.



people who explicitly state when and where their new behaviors are going to happen are much more likely to stick to their goals.

	For example, if you want to start a daily meditation habit this month, then you'll be more likely to stick to your goal if you plan out when and where you'll meditate each day.
