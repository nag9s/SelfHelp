## \#1 - WILL

NO, this is not what you think I mean! And it's also NOT willpower that I mean

What this is about is:

Knowing what you really want!

I have a quick test for you:

Take a piece of paper/open wordpad! Write down the 6 most important goals or dreams you have in the order of how important they are to you! 3 material and 3 non-material.

Don't skip this! DO IT! It's important for you! You have 10 seconds!

You should be able to do it in this time! To be honest, you should be able to do this without thinking!

If you did so! Congratulations, you are ahead of 95% of the people out there! Probably more!

BUT if you cant, you're having a big problem. You basically have no clue what you're doing with your life.

The \# 1 key to archieve success is to know exactly what you WANT!

I mean what you really WANT!!! Thats a feeling!

Not the "I'm hungry lets go to McDonalds" kind of "want".

Im talking about the "I'm drowning!!!! I WANT/NEED air" kind of feeling!

If you're looking at your list. And your \#1 goal on each side is not triggering this feeling. Then you dont really want it.

If your top goals dont trigger your emotions in this way. Take time to think about your goals. It may be you are working for the wrong thing!

If you failed the test, or even if you didn't I have an instant way for you to get closer to your goals:

##### Write a GOAL-LIST!

-Open an excel document

-Make a table with a material side and a non material side.

-Add 10 lines to each side

-Sit down and write down 10 material and 10 non material goals! Dont stand up before!!!

-Add a an exact price to each material goal. DO RESEARCH!

-Add a date that you want to reach your goal at!!!

Disclaimer: "Happiness", "Being healthy". ARE NOT GOALS! Theyre not defined!

An example for an non material: - 1\) Read a good book every month.

General rule: You need to be able to imagine every goal you have exactly! You have to define things!!!

Are you done with this?

I am happy to tell you that youve done half of your job already now. This is the most important thing for you! Be sure to check this list every day! Print it! Put it in your purse!

Everytime you have archieved a goal, put another one on the list! NEVER let it go under 10 on each side!!!

Its not only helping you to archieve your goals, but also to actually think about what you REALLY want to archieve and do in and with your life!

## \#2- Opportunities!

Well, lets be fair... I know what your thinking, you can't affect how much opportunities you are getting. So basically this is not the right thing...
