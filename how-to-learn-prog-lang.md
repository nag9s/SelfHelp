# How To Learn Prog Lang

To learn a new programming language, you will need a mixture of theoretical knowledge and

**a lot of practice**

\(notice the emphasize on the practice\).

## Theory:

Here is a road map that I follow:

1. Learn the

   **basic syntax**

   : basic data types, loops, conditional statements. You could use an

   **online introductory course**

   \(which is a good way for you to start learning\).

2. Program a

   **small project**

   : this project should use the previously learned basic syntax. Write a program that asks for a user name and age or a simple calculator. Don't overwhelm yourself with complicated. Keep it simple at this stage.

3. Repeat the two previous steps until you start feeling

   **confident**

   .

4. Work on a

   **"real" programming**

   problem.  By real, I mean something that is bigger than a college assignment and that needs more than few weeks to be completed. Pick up a project that your are passionate about \(say online learning\) and try to write a program for this project. Take your time. Search the internet. Ask for help. All the means are good to progress.

5. Read a lot of

   **good code**

   . You can check open source projects on

   **Github**

   or ask your friends if they have access to any high quality code.

6. Go back to step one and now add

   **more involved concepts**

   : some object oriented programming, how to structure big projects, learn frameworks, best practices, etc.... A programming book at this stage could give you a boost.

   **Youtube**

   is also a good source to watch tutorials and past conferences.

7. Work on

   **more challenging problems**

   . Start answering questions online \(quora, stackoverflow...\), get involved in the community, go to meetings.

8. Enjoy it!
