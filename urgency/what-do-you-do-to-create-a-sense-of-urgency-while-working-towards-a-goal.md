# What do you do to create a sense of urgency while working towards a goal?

Is it a goal or task? I'm not sure how I'd answer for a goal, but for a task, give yourself an impossible deadline.

"I need to contact 30 apartment managers in two hours." That actually doesn't sound all that pressing, so try "I need to contact 30 apartment managers in 30 minutes."
