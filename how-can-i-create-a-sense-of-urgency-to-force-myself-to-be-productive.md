Before you write me off as a foul-mouth “know it all,” hear me out. Chances are, you’ve been lied to about how to become more productive.

Here’s the truth: **most productivity advice doesn’t work.**

And I would know, because I’ve tried all the “productivity hacks” out there.

**Do any of these sound familiar?**

* **You force yourself to wake up at 5am to complete your complex, drawn-out morning ritual.**
* **You “chunk” and “time block” and love  your 25-minute Pomodoros.**
* **You have every To-do app on the market neatly organized on your iPhone and computer in a folder labeled, **
  **“Productivity.”**

**Yup… these all failed me, too.**

Sure, you may see some results, but these surface-level tactics are nothing to write home about.

In my experience, **True Productivity comes with 3 simple strategies.**

To help you understand the essence of these mysterious ways, imagine this:

You’re a caveman walking home from a long day’s hunt.

You’re tired. And, admittedly, you’re feeling down after a less-than-stellar performance with the boys \(or girls\).

You yawn.

Just then, you spot a **saber-tooth tiger staring right at you.**

In an instant, your primal instincts take over and force your body into a full sprint in the opposite direction. Chemicals are pumping from your brain through your blood and into your muscles, united by the sole desire to stay alive.

This is the same reaction you must create in yourself to experience True Productivity. In a way, this is what you experienced today during your 3-hour exam.

Instead of a saber-tooth tiger chasing after you, you were faced with a hard deadline and serious consequences. Don’t finish your exam? No problem—you’ll fail. Say goodbye to your diploma and dream school!

**Your only choice today was to succeed. And you’re right: if you took this assignment home, it would’ve taken you 3 weeks instead of 3 hours.**

**The question remains:**

**How do we create these same conditions in our everyday lives to get more done than we ever thought possible?**

#### **\#1. Real & Hard Deadlines**

Deadlines are the fuel to True Productivity.

But, **there’s a difference between the deadlines you set for yourself and the deadlines that involve other people.**

For example, I set a deadline to write this Quora answer in 30 minutes. I’m now on minute 42. My own deadline was not enough to get my ass in gear and perform.

On the other hand, I promised my client his email autoresponder would be built by Wednesday at 7pm. You best believe I buckled down and finished the work.

##### **Takeaway:With everything you do, try to set deadlines that involve others. You won’t let them down.**

#### **\#2. Snap Out of Perfectionism & “Just Ship It.”**

Your words: “I feel like, if given the assignment to take home, it would have taken me twice the time.”

Why do you think this is? I’ll tell you why:

1. You’d outline your essays.
2. You’d write your essays.
3. You’d double-check your essays.
4. You’d triple-check your essays.

In short, you’d make them perfect.

Today, on the other hand, you didn’t have this luxury. You were in a “Just Ship It” mentality.

The result? You got it done.

And, again, you’re trying to get more done in less time. The “Just Ship It” mentality helps you do just that.

##### **Takeaway:**With everything you do, just get a Version One and send it out in the world. Get feedback. And, if you have the time, perfect it later.

**\#3. Who Are You Hanging Out With?**

You’ve heard it before.

“You’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with.”

* If you hang out with fat people, you’ll get fat.
* If you hang out with fit people, you’ll get fit.
* If you hang out with people talk and take no action, you won’t get shit done.
* If you hang out with people who set 
  real deadlines
   and 
  “just ship it,”
   you’ll get shit done.

It’s that simple.

**Takeaway:**Surround yourself with the doers, the action-takers, the achievers. Avoid the talkers, the planners, the strategizers.

You see, if you want to get more done in less time, tactics won’t work.

Your brain is too smart.

It wants comfort; it doesn’t want to work.

You must make yourself believe if you don’t get it done, then there will be serious consequences. Hence, why I opened this answer the way I did…

Your best option is to fuck with yourself into believing these consequences exist.
