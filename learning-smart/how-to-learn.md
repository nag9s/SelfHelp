# How To Learn

**Tips:**

* Take notes
* Post your questions in the Q & A section \(see "ask good questions" below\)
* Depending on your background, do realise that most exercises will take a lot of effort to complete
* Be an active learner. Write your own code. Don’t just watch passively
* Reality check: It takes time to solve difficult problem and often you solve them by parts. That is how you learn to solve problem. The more you do the better you get.

**Debug Your Code:**

* Read the error messages
* Remove all the code and just add it back line-by-line
* Compare your code against my code and try to identify the problem

**Find Solutions Online:**

* Google the specific error message + Python \(or any relevant language\)
* Google “How do I ...?”

**Ask Good Questions:**

* Be positive
* Be specific – give the few lines of code that are causing the problem
* Be thankful and express it
* Try to answer someone else’s questions. The best way to learn is to teach!
