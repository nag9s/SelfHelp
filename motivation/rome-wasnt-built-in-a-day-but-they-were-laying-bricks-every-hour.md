# Rome Wasn't Built in a Day, But They Were Laying Bricks Every Hour

 It takes time — sometimes years — to master a skill, craft, or habit.



The problem is that it can be really easy to overestimate the importance of building your Roman empire and underestimate the importance of laying another brick.





 Focusing on your habits is more important than worrying about your outcomes.



You don't have to build everything you want today, but you do have to find a way to lay another brick.



You can start small. You can focus on improving 1 percent each day. You can simply put in another rep.
