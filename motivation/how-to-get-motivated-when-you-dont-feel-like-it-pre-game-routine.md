#### How You Can Use a Pre–Game Routine to Get Motivated

```
    a pre–game routine is that allowed to perform well, regardless of whether  motivated or not.

    While this routine physically warmed me up to play, it also — and perhaps more importantly — put me in the correct mental state to compete at a high level. Even if I wasn’t feeling up for the game at the beginning, by the time I finished my pre–game routine, I was in “game mode.”

     My pre–game routine started a cascade of internal events that pulled me into the right frame of mind and made it more likely that I would succeed.

    Imagine if you had a routine that could pull you into “exercise mode” or “work mode”, no matter how little motivation you had at the start.

    Do you think these people always feel motivated? No way. There are some days when the most talented people in the world wake up feeling like sluggish lard bombs.

    But they use their pre–game routines to pull them into the right mental state, regardless of how they feel. You can use this same process to overcome your motivation threshold and consistently exercise, study, write, speak, or perform any other task that is important to you.

    **Here’s how to do it…

#### 3 Steps For Developing Your Routine

```
        Step 1: A good pre–game routine starts by being so easy that you can’t say no to it. You shouldn’t need motivation to start your pre–game routine.

            For example…

            My writing routine starts by getting a glass of water. So easy, I can’t say no.

            My weightlifting routine starts by putting on my lifting shoes. So easy, I can’t say no.

            My pitching routine started by picking up a baseball and my glove. So easy, I couldn’t say no. \(Also, my coach would have yelled at me.\)

            motivation often comes after starting. That's why your pre–game routine needs to be incredibly easy to start.

        Step 2: Your routine should get you moving towards the end goal.

            Most of the time, your routine should include physical movement. It's hard to think yourself into getting motivated.

            Here's why…

            What is your body language like when you're feeling unmotivated or lacking energy?

            Answer: You're not moving very much. Maybe you're slumped over like a blob, slowly melting into the couch. This lack of physical movement is directly linked to a lack of mental energy.

            Related: physical movement doesn't have to mean exercise. For example, if your goal is to write, then your routine should bring you closer to the physical act of writing.

            While your routine should be as easy as possible to start, it should gradually transition into more and more physical movement. Your mind and your motivation will follow your physical movement.

        Step 3: You need to follow the same pattern every single time.

            The primary purpose of your pre–game routine is to create a series of events that you always perform before doing a specific task. Your pre–game routine tells your mind, “This is what happens before I do \_\_\_.”

            Eventually, this routine becomes so tied to your performance that by simply doing the routine, you are pulled into a mental state that is primed to perform. You don't need motivation, you just need to start your routine.

            If you remember the article on the 3 R’s of Habit Change, then you may realize that your pre–game routine is basically creating a “reminder” for yourself. Your pre–game routine is the trigger that kickstarts your habit, even if you’re not motivated to do it.

            This is important because when you don't feel motivated, it's often too much work to figure out what you should do next. When faced with another decision, you will often decide to just quit. However, the pre–game routine solves that problem because you know exactly what to do next. There's no debating or decision making. You just follow the pattern.

    How to Get Motivated: Make Excellence a Routine

        If you’ve taught yourself to believe certain limitations, then you can also teach yourself to break through them.

        The patterns that you repeat on a daily basis will eventually form the identity that you believe in and the actions that you take. You can transform your identity and become the type of person who doesn’t need motivation to perform well.

         why it’s so critical to do your pre–game routine every time, not just when you’re struggling with a lack of motivation.

        These small behaviors reinforce your good habits and the feelings that come with them. Pretty soon, your pre–game routine will not only be a trigger that kickstarts your habit, but also a reminder of what you’re working towards and the type of person you are becoming.

        If you only work when you feel motivated, then you’ll never be consistent enough to become a pro

        But if you build small routines and patterns that help you overcome the daily battles, then you’ll continue the slow march towards greatness even when it gets tough.
