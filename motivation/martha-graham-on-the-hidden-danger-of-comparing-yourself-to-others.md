# Martha Graham on the Hidden Danger of Comparing Yourself to Others

> It is not your business to determine how good it is nor how valuable nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel open.

#### The Uselessness of Judging Yourself

“I thought this was a good article. Why don't people seem to enjoy it?” Or, I'll feel like I wrote something average only to see it become the most popular post of the month.

Regardless of the outcome, I've realized one thing: we are often terrible judges of our own work.

Martha Graham's advice takes this concept a step further by explaining that not only are you a bad judge of your own work, it is not your job to judge your own work.

It is not your place to compare it to others. It is not your responsibility to figure out how valuable it is or how useful it can be. It is not your job to tell yourself, “No.”

Instead, your responsibility is to create. Your job is share what you have to offer from where you are right now.

To quote Pema Chodron, the Buddhist teacher, your job is to “come as you are.” \\(And then find your inner Sisu and keep coming.\\)

every artist will judge their work. The key is to not let your self-judgment keep you from doing your thing. Professionals produce, even when it isn't easy.

#### Keep Your Eyes on Your Own Paper

It doesn't make a difference what the person next to you writes down for his answer. This is your race to run.

It's your assignment to complete. It's your answer to create. How your paper compares to someone else's is not the point. The point is to fill the paper with your work.

The same can be said of your work today. No matter what you spend your days doing, every morning you wake up and have a blank piece of paper to work with. You get to put your name at the top and fill it with your work.

If what you write on your paper doesn't meet someone else's expectations … it is no concern of yours. The way someone else perceives what you do is a result of their own experiences \\(which you can't control\\), their own tastes and preferences \\(which you can't predict\\), and their own expectations \\(which you don't set\\). If your choices don't match their expectations that is their concern, not yours.

Your concern is to do the work, not to judge it. Your concern is to fall in love with the process, not to grade the outcome. Keep your eyes on your own paper.
