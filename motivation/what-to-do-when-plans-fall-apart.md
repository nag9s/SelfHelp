# What to Do When Plans Fall Apart

What to Do When Plans Fall Apart

use the “if–then” version of this strategy.

you simply plan for unexpected situations by using the phrase, “If \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_, then \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_.”





For example…







If I eat fast food for lunch, then I'll stop by the store and buy some vegetables for dinner.







If I haven't called my mom back by 7pm, then I won't turn on the TV until I do.







If my meeting runs over and I don't have time to workout this afternoon, then I'll wake up early tomorrow and run.
