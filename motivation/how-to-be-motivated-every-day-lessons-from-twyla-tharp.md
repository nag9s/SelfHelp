# How to Be Motivated Every Day: Lessons from Twyla Tharp

“I begin each day of my life with a ritual; I wake up at 5:30 A.M., put on my workout clothes, my leg warmers, my sweatshirts, and my hat. I walk outside my Manhattan home, hail a taxi, and tell the driver to take me to the Pumping Iron gym at 91st street and First Avenue, where I workout for two hours. The ritual is not the stretching and weight training I put my body through each morning at the gym; the ritual is the cab. The moment I tell the driver where to go I have completed the ritual.

It's a simple act, but doing it the same way each morning habitualizes it — makes it repeatable, easy to do. It reduces the chance that I would skip it or do it differently. It is one more item in my arsenal of routines, and one less thing to think about.”

Let's talk about what makes Tharp's morning ritual so important and how we can use it to master our own habits.

#### The Surprising Thing About Motivation

```
the surprising thing about motivation: it often comes after starting a new behavior, not before. Getting started is a form of active inspiration that naturally produces momentum.



You have probably experienced this phenomenon before. For example, going for a run may seem overwhelming or exhausting just to think about before you begin, but if you can muster up the energy to start jogging, you'll often find that you become more motivated to finish as you go.



In other words, it's easier to finish the run than it was to start it in the first place.



Newton's First Law applied to habit formation: objects in motion tend to stay in motion. And that means getting started is the hardest part.



I often find this to be true with my articles. Once I begin writing, it's much easier for me to power through and finish. However, if I'm staring at a blank page, it can seem overwhelming and taxing to take the first step.



And this, my friends, is where Twyla Tharp's morning ritual comes back into the picture.

#### Rituals Are an On Ramp for Your Behavior

```
The power of a ritual, or what I like to call a pre-game routine, is that it provides a mindless way to initiate your behavior. It makes starting your habits easier and that means following through on a consistent basis is easier.



In other words, getting started with a simple ritual like putting on a helmet or checking the air in the bike tires makes it easier to follow through on the bigger behavior \\(making the commute\\). If you focus on the ritual, the next step follows more automatically.



The key to any good ritual is that it removes the need to make a decision: What should I do first? When should I do this? How should I do this? Most people never get moving because they can't decide how to get started. Having a ritual takes that burden off your shoulders.

#### The Idea in Practice

    Here are some other examples of how you can apply ritual and routine to your habits and behaviors:

1. Exercise more consistently: Use the same warm up routine in the gym
2. Become more creative: Follow a creative ritual before you start writing or painting or singing
3. Start each day stress free: Create a five-minute morning meditation ritual
4. Sleep better: Follow a “power down” routine before bed

   When you master the ability to mindlessly initiate the tasks that are important to you, it's not necessary to rely on motivation and willpower to make them happen.
