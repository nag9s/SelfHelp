**Humans are motivated by 2 main forces...1. To avoid pain or 2. To gain pleasure...**The need to avoid pain is much greater and you can use pain to the advantage if you're smart about it.  Now, the mind doesn't know the difference between something that's real and something that you vividly imagine.  **You need to vividly imagine something extremely painful that will take place if you don't get urgency and take action...you need to vividly replay it in your mind very often.  See, the strategy of putting that picture of the dream house on your cork board doesn't push you hard enough.  How about if someone you love is taken from you and you won't get them back until you complete the action you need to complete.  That event will give you the ultimate urgency. ** It's no coincidence that there are soooo many "rags to riches" stories..."Rags" are so painful that they push you past your pain threshold and then ultimate urgency kicks in and you are able to do things you never would imagine.  Urgency is awesome because it carries around an entourage of other great success traits and it also wipes away all of our fears\(shyness, rejection, etc\).   Now the trick is to turn on that urgent psychology at will:\)

I find that if I'm running late and need to get something done before I go I work incredibly fast and am very productive. However, if I'm given long stretches of time it's too easy to get distracted. **You can create a forced sense of urgency by promising to deliver something to someone at a certain point in time. If you have a project that you know you will put off, promise to turn it over to someone to review at 4 PM. **By doing so, you'll move on it sooner in the day.

There's a name for this: Parkinson's law \([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par)...

```
Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.
```

**Artificially create a time constraint for yourself and you'll find yourself getting work done sooner/more quickly.**



The thing you’re working on must have consequences if it is not completed on time. You’ll lose a customer, make others late on their schedule, violate the terms of a contract, etc.



People fall into 3 types:



    Those that worry about the consequences obsessively, so they start early and finish the task so they can relieve their anxiety. \(I’m in this category\)

    Those that don’t obsessively worry, they schedule a reasonable amount of time and stick to the schedule.

    Those that can’t get motivated unless there is a high sense of urgency. For example, there are only 4 hours remaining to perform 6 hours of work. For some people, this is their standard mode and how they create their best work. It gets them into a flow state.



If you want to get your work done more proactively, you might try setting an artificial deadline.



The only problem with this - in the back of your mind you know it’s not real.



If you naturally fall into one of the 3 types I described, you can always just accept it.



I’ve accepted the fact that get a little OCD concerning important work. Doing it any other way isn’t an option. I don’t fight it.
