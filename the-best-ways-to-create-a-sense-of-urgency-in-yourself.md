 **Humans are motivated by 2 main forces...1. To avoid pain or 2. To gain pleasure...**The need to avoid pain is much greater and you can use pain to the advantage if you're smart about it.  Now, the mind doesn't know the difference between something that's real and something that you vividly imagine.  **You need to vividly imagine something extremely painful that will take place if you don't get urgency and take action...you need to vividly replay it in your mind very often.

How about if someone you love is taken from you and you won't get them back until you complete the action you need to complete.  That event will give you the ultimate urgency. ** It's no coincidence that there are soooo many "rags to riches" stories..."Rags" are so painful that they push you past your pain threshold and then ultimate urgency kicks in and you are able to do things you never would imagine.  Urgency is awesome because it carries around an entourage of other great success traits and it also wipes away all of our fears\(shyness, rejection, etc\).

I find that if I'm running late and need to get something done before I go I work incredibly fast and am very productive. However, if I'm given long stretches of time it's too easy to get distracted. **You can create a forced sense of urgency by promising to deliver something to someone at a certain point in time. If you have a project that you know you will put off, promise to turn it over to someone to review at 4 PM. **By doing so, you'll move on it sooner in the day.



There's a name for this: Parkinson's law \(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par...

    Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.

**Artificially create a time constraint for yourself and you'll find yourself getting work done sooner/more quickly.**
